# Code Speedruns

Some ideas to test my ability for rapid development. Set a timer and get to
work!

## Unit testing for `StandardGame`

- --COMPLETE-- 
    - Modify `StandardGame` / `Deck` for a testing mode:
        - Does not randomize seating
        - Does not shuffle deck
        - Let's deck state be directly set
        - Can set the points manually
        - Implement a `TestPlayer` `Player` class that can be fed a list of responses to
          make
        - 1 hr goal (5 hours)

- Finish all tests in test\_standardgame.py
    - Create a list of correct logs to compare the tests against
    - 1-2 hr

## Testing tool for custom Players

- Confirms every function was implemented and gives valid responses 
- Simple console command to test a `Player` class

## A smarter AI

- Uses simple heuristics to make decisions about what cards to play
- Provides a good baseline for comparing and training of other AI

## Integration testing for playing games on the server
