# Code Speedruns

Some ideas to test my ability for rapid development. Set a timer and get to
work!

## Unit testing for `StandardGame`

- Modify `StandardGame` / `Deck` for a testing mode:
    - Does not randomize seating
    - Does not shuffle deck
    - Let's deck state be directly set
    - Can set the points manually
    - Implement a `TestPlayer` `Player` class that can be fed a list of responses to
      make
    - 1 hr goal

- Finish all tests in test\_standardgame.py

## Testing tool for custom Players

- Confirms every function was implemented and gives valid responses 
- Simple console command to test a `Player` class

## A smarter AI

- Uses simple heuristics to make decisions about what cards to play
- Provides a good baseline for comparing and training of other AI

## Integration testing for playing games on the server
